# Results and Conclusions 

.pull-left[

- Lemur populations have been largely grown in captivity due to deforestation and displacement

# Conclusion

.pull-left[

- We concentrated our data by focusing on 5 species of lemurs

- (I really need to see the other slides before making a quick conclusion)

- We did this

- We did that

- We did this some more

- Lemur lifespans heavily depends on weight, sex does not play a major determining factor in lifespan

--

- A higher litter size usually means a high lifespan as well. Also depends on weight because smaller lemur species who have a higher litter size will still have a relatively small lifespan.
