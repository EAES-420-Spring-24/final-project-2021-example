Introduction
  We began the presentation with an introduction slide titled: "The State of Lemurs: An An exploration into 5 lemur species populations at The Duke Lemur Center". I added a photo of one of the lemur enclosures as the background of this slide and spoke a bit about the Duke Lemur Center and it's focus on conservation. The center houses 72 different species of lemurs so as a group we decided on 5 with methods that will be discussed later in this summary. I added pictures of the lemurs to the first few slides to introduce everyone to the lemurs we were going to be discussing. The five were the Coquerel’s Sifaka, the Gray Mouse Lemur, the Slow Loris, the Fat-Tailed Dwarf Lemur, and the Ring Tailed Lemur known throughout the presentation as their shortened taxon codes PCOQ, MMUR, NCOU, CMED, and LCAT, respectively.

Conclusion

  Now let’s sum up and discuss conclusion we found. First, lemur populations have been largely grown in captivity due to deforestation and displacement. This was made evident by this sanctuary’s data. We concentrated this data by focusing on 5 key species of lemurs in our data set. We found that lemur lifespans heavily depend on weight, while sex does not play a major determining factor in lifespan. We also observed that a higher litter size usually means a high lifespan as well. And finally, we found that lifespan also depends more heavily on weight than on litter size as smaller lemur species who have a higher litter size will still have a relatively small lifespan.
	These are important finding for the future of these lemur species. While the lemurs discussed here are not all the most endangered species of lemur, the data we recovered from them can be used to protect those species which are.
