Introduction
  We began the presentation with an introduction slide titled: "The State of Lemurs: An An exploration into 5 lemur species populations at The Duke Lemur Center". I added a photo of one of the lemur enclosures as the background of this slide and spoke a bit about the Duke Lemur Center and it's focus on conservation. The center houses 72 different species of lemurs so as a group we decided on 5 with methods that will be discussed later in this summary. I added pictures of the lemurs to the first few slides to introduce everyone to the lemurs we were going to be discussing. The five were the Coquerelâ€™s Sifaka, the Gray Mouse Lemur, the Slow Loris, the Fat-Tailed Dwarf Lemur, and the Ring Tailed Lemur known throughout the presentation as their shortened taxon codes PCOQ, MMUR, NCOU, CMED, and LCAT, respectively.
