We wanted to take a look at how the lemurs were aging and how their lifespan is affected by life at the sanctuary and if they are at greater risk of going extinct because of it. So we decided to plot out the Date of Death by Age at Death of the lemurs as well as include a linear fit. CMED, LCAT, NCOU, and PCOQ all show that they are in fact living a lot longer over time. PCOQ does have a lot of infant or near infant deaths compared to the other 3, with LCAT also having an abnormally high amount. MMUR on the other hand is the only species of the 5 we chose that shows they are not living longer during their stay at the sanctuary. They already rarely live to 15 years old as it is, but this is still a startling trend. It could mean that the population at the sanctuary is missing something that they normally have in the wild. Alternatively this species may be dying out regardless of what we do for them.
